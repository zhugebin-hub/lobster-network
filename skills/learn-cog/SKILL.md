# Learn Cog - The Tutor That Explains Five Different Ways

**The best tutors explain the same concept five different ways.** CellCog does too.

#1 on DeepResearch Bench (Feb 2026) for reasoning depth — deep enough to break concepts into first principles — combined with multi-modal output for every learning style: diagrams, analogies, worked examples, practice problems, interactive explanations, and full study guides. Any subject, any level.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the `cellcog` skill for SDK setup and API calls.

```bash
clawhub install cellcog
```

**Read the cellcog skill first** for SDK setup. This skill shows you what's possible.

**Quick pattern (v1.0+):**
```python
# Fire-and-forget - returns immediately
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your learning request]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="learning-task",
    chat_mode="agent"  # Agent mode for most learning
)
# Daemon notifies you when complete - do NOT poll
```

## How Learn-Cog Helps

### Concept Explanations

Understand anything:

- **Break It Down**: "Explain quantum entanglement like I'm 10 years old"
- **Multiple Angles**: "Explain recursion using 3 different analogies"
- **Deep Dives**: "Give me a comprehensive explanation of how neural networks learn"
- **Visual Learning**: "Create a diagram explaining the water cycle"

**Example prompt:**
> "Explain blockchain technology:
> 
> Level: Complete beginner, no tech background
> 
> Include:
> - Simple analogy to start
> - How transactions work
> - Why it's secure
> - Real-world examples
> - Common misconceptions
> 
> Use simple language, avoid jargon. Include a visual diagram."

### Homework & Problem Solving

Work through problems:

- **Math Problems**: "Solve this calculus problem and explain each step"
- **Science Questions**: "Help me understand this physics concept and solve these problems"
- **Essay Help**: "Help me structure an essay on the causes of World War I"
- **Code Debugging**: "Explain why my code isn't working and help me fix it"

**Example prompt:**
> "Help me understand this math problem:
> 
> Problem: Find the derivative of f(x) = x³sin(x)
> 
> I know basic derivatives but I'm confused about the product rule.
> 
> Please:
> 1. Remind me of the product rule
> 2. Apply it step by step
> 3. Give me 2 similar problems to practice
> 4. Show me how to check my answer"

### Study Materials

Prepare for success:

- **Study Guides**: "Create a study guide for AP Chemistry exam"
- **Flashcards**: "Generate 50 flashcards for Spanish vocabulary"
- **Practice Tests**: "Create a practice quiz on US History 1900-1950"
- **Summary Notes**: "Summarize Chapter 5 of my biology textbook"
- **Cheat Sheets**: "Create a one-page reference for Python syntax"

**Example prompt:**
> "Create a comprehensive study guide for the AWS Solutions Architect exam:
> 
> Cover:
> - Key services and when to use them
> - Networking concepts

**Example prompt:**
> "Teach me React hooks:
> 
> My level: I know basic JavaScript and HTML/CSS, never used React
> 
> Structure:
> 1. What problem do hooks solve?
> 2. useState with simple examples
> 3. useEffect with practical use cases
> 4. When to use which hook
> 5. A mini-project putting it together
> 
> Include code examples I can run."

### Language Learning

Master new languages:

## Chat Mode for Learning

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Homework help, concept explanations, practice problems | `"agent"` |
| Comprehensive study guides, full curriculum design, deep research | `"agent team"` |

**Use `"agent"` for most learning.** Quick explanations, homework help, and study materials execute well in agent mode.

**Use `"agent team"` for comprehensive learning** - full course outlines, research papers, or when you need multi-source synthesis.

## Tips for Better Learning

1. **State your level**: "Complete beginner" vs "I understand the basics" changes everything.

2. **Ask why**: Don't just ask for answers. Ask for explanations of the reasoning.

3. **Request practice**: Learning happens through doing. Ask for practice problems.

4. **Admit confusion**: "I don't understand the part where..." helps CellCog target explanations.

5. **Build on previous**: Reference what you already understand to get appropriate explanations.

6. **Active recall**: Ask CellCog to quiz you, not just explain. Testing improves retention.
